Easily require your customers to buy a minimum / maximum / incremental amount of products. Supports decimal quantities.

== Description ==
NOTE: This plugin has been forked from the "Advanced Product Quantities" plugin. It adds decimal quantities support and 
units to products. Please don't attempt to run both plugins simultaneously. It not needed and the universe will 
probably implode.

With Quantities and Units for WooCommerce you can easily create rules that restrict the amount of products a user can 
buy at once. Set Minimum, Maximum and Step values for any product type and must be valid before a customer can proceed 
to checkout. Quantities and Units also bring decimal quantity support to WooCommerce.

This plugin works great with [Rapid Order](http://rapidorderplugin.com/), a fast ordering system for WooCommerce. 

New Features

* Allow decimal quantities (configure this in Quantity Rule -> Advanced Rule -> Site Wide Step Value)
* Specify a unit of measurement for the quantity (ie lbs, kg, bag etc)

Features:

* Added Custom Quantity Message Option
* Added Out of Stock Min/Max
* Added Role Support, create rules based on user roles.
* Improved performance / caching

* Set rule priority to layer multiple rules on top of each other
* Add your rule based input boxes to products thumbnails using [WooCommerce Thumbnail Input Quantities](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-thumbnail-input-quantities/installation/)
* Easily override rules on a per-product basis
* Integrates with [WooCommerce's Product CSV Import Suite](http://www.woothemes.com/products/product-csv-import-suite/)
* See which rule is being applied to an individual product on your edit product page
* Now fully supports ALL PRODUCT TYPES, simple, variable, grouped and affiliate
